  |     DLC Title ID: 010044500c183001                                      |

  |   Jayavarman VII leads Khmer and Dyah Gitarja leads Indonesia in        |
  |   Sid Meier's Civilization VI! Though each is versatile and unique,     |
  |   both civilizations bring new challengers to the religious game.       |
  |   Indonesia is a strong coastal civilization with potential for a       |
  |   huge Jong-powered navy, and the Khmer thrive in their populous        |
  |   riverside cities. Both of these civilizations come into play in       |
  |   the new 'Path to Nirvana' scenario, where you compete to have the     |
  |   most followers of your religion on a unique Southeast Asia map.       |
  |                                                                         |

  |   - Nubia Civilization & Scenario Pack                                  |
  |     DLC Title ID: 010044500c183002                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Amanitore leads Nubia in Sid Meier's Civilization VI!                 |
  |   Nubia's ranged units are strong, easy to build and quick promote,     |
  |   and they can use their unique Nubian Pyramid improvement to boost     |
  |   the construction and yield of districts.                              |
  |   If you want to build a strong foundation early in the game for        |
  |   success, then Nubia is the right civ for you.                         |
  |                                                                         |
